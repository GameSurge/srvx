   	      srvx Installation Instructions

Introduction:
----------
If you encounter any problems compiling/running srvx, please make sure
you have followed the directions in this file correctly and that all
of the requirements listed below are met.

If the problem persists, report it to one (or all) of the coders
listed in the AUTHORS file. Please try to include ALL relevant
information about the error/bug, including anything out of the
ordinary reported from make and the appropriate entries from the log
files.

Requirements:
----------
This release of srvx (1.3) only supports the Undernet P10 and Bahamut
protocols and is known to link with ircu/Universal (u2.10.09),
ircu/Undernet (u2.10.10, u2.10.11), ircu-lain, and Bahamut 1.4.32. It
does not support hybrid, Unreal, or any other ircd not listed. Should
you find other compatible ircds, please let us know.  Most of the
testing has been done on ircu2.10.11.06.

srvx is known to compile on the following systems as long as you
are using GNU make (make on Linux, gmake on many other systems):

  * Linux (libc5 or glibc2); glibc2.1 recommended+    (SPARC, ALPHA, x86, PPC)
  * FreeBSD 4.x; tested on 4.2-RELEASE and 4.2-STABLE (SPARC, x86)
  * FreeBSD 3.x; tested on 3.3-RELEASE and 3.4-STABLE (SPARC, x86)
  * FreeBSD 2.x; tested on 2.2.8-RELEASE	      (SPARC, x86)
  * NetBSD 1.6+;                        	      (ALPHA, MIPS, x86)
  * SunOS 5.x; tested on 5.8			      (SPARC, x86)
  * OpenBSD 2.x; tested on 2.8			      (x86)
  * BSDi 4.x; tested on 4.0.1			      (x86)
  * CYGWIN 1.1.x and 1.3.x; tested on 1.1.8	      (x86)

For the Linux kernel, srvx has been tested on Debian 2.x - 3.x, and
Redhat 5.x - 8.x.

srvx should compile on other system types also.  If you have success
on other platforms/archs or problems on any platforms/archs, please
contact the authors to let us know.

gcc 2.96 tends to emit spurious warnings; before reporting any
compiler warnings from it, make sure you are using the most recent
version of it or try using an official release of gcc.

You may also have trouble unless your compiler's C preprocessor
supports ISO C99 varadic macros.  gcc is the compiler we use for
almost all our testing, and we recommend it for use with srvx.

Quick Install:
----------
$ libtoolize --force
$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ automake --force-missing --add-missing
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
    NOTE: The protocol the resulting srvx binary will support is
    determined by the configure script. The P10 protocol is the
    default; if you would like to link to Bahamut, you must pass
    the --with-protocol=bahamut flag to the configure script:
    $ ./configure --with-protocol=bahamut
$ make
$ ${EDITOR} srvx.conf
    NOTE: You may want to copy srvx.conf.example to srvx.conf and
    edit that.
$ ./srvx

Compiling:
----------
  1) Enter the root directory of the srvx tree.  If installation is done
     from outside of it, it may cause problems during compile, or during
     runtime.
     
  2) Run autotools to create the configure script and files needed by it
     $ libtoolize --force
     $ aclocal
     $ autoheader
     $ automake --force-missing --add-missing
     $ autoconf

  3) Run the configure script (sh configure), it will verify that your
     system will have the resources needed for srvx to compile.  If you
     would like to change the path where srvx will be installed to,
     execute configure with the --prefix=/path option.  The default path
     is ~/srvx-X.X.X/, with the X's representing the version.  See the
     note in "Quick Install" if you are linking to Bahamut.

  4) On some systems you may need to edit the Makefile in order for
     it to compile correctly.  Includes, and other such things may
     reside in other directories.  Most likely the Makefile won't require
     any modifications.

  5) You may optionally edit config.h in case the configure script made a
     mistake.

  6) Execute the "make" command to begin compiling.  If you encounter any
     uncorrectable errors/warnings, please scroll up to the introduction
     section and follow the instructions.

  7) You may now either type "make install" to install it to your
     installation path, or work from your build directory, either is fine.

  8) Copy sockcheck.conf.example to sockcheck.conf (and edit to add
     new proxy types, if you wish).

  9) Copy srvx.conf.example to srvx.conf and edit to suit your
     needs. Errors in the configuration file will be logged to
     main.log (and if srvx is running in the foreground, printed to
     stdout) when you start the daemon.

 10) You can now begin using your service bots.  You can debug by
     running it with '-fd', it will not background itself, and it
     will be fairly verbose if you gave the configure script the
     --enable-debug flag. If you would like to run in the foreground
     with no verbosity, use the '-f' flag. If you just want to run it,
     execute srvx without any flags.

 11) Once you have srvx started, you'll need to register a NickServ
     account:
       /msg NickServ@services.irc.com register <account> <password>
     Make sure that you register the first account -- it is
     automatically granted certain privileges and gives you root-level
     access to OpServ once you are opered up.

 12) New operators can be given access to OpServ through NickServ's
     (or whatever you've named the nick/authentication service) oset
     command:
       /msg NickServ oset <nick>|*<account> level <level>
     Levels are generally beween 0 and 1000 by convention; higher
     numbers correspond to more access. You can also add helpers
     (users with extra privileges such as security override in
     traditional configurations) through NickServ:
       /msg NickServ oset <nick>|*<account> flags +H

End of file, INSTALL.
